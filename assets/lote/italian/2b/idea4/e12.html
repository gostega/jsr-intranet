			<h2>Attivit&agrave; 12 Souvenir e regali!</h2>
			<p>An important aspect of travelling is shopping for those memorable souvenirs for yourself and presents for your family and friends back at home.</p>
			<p>What will you buy for yourself to remind you of the wonderful <em>soggiorno</em> that you have experienced <em>nella bella Italia</em>?</p>
			<p>What will you buy your family and friends?</p>
			
			<div class="box att" title="Attention"><br />
				Buy tasteful things that are typically Italian. There is no point buying things that can be easily found back at home. This does not mean <em>che devi spendere un patrimonio!</em></div>
				
			<ol>
				<li>Make a list of the things that you would like to buy for yourself and also in which city you plan to buy them. Write them in the <span class="boldItal">Lista shopping</span>.</li>
				<li>Make a list of the gifts you plan to buy for family and friends and also in which city you plan to buy them. Write them in the <span class="boldItal">Lista regali</span>.</li>
				<li>Keep within your budget! Use this <a href="docs/ws_4.doc" target="_blank">worksheet</a> to make a note of how much you have allowed for presents and how much you expect to spend on each present.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<div class="box att" title="Attention">
				<p><strong>Shopping online</strong></p>
				<p>If you don&rsquo;t like shopping, take the pain out of the experience and shop online. Also it&rsquo;s very convenient if you have limited time. You can also avoid the extra stress of carrying extra weight with you and have the goods delivered to your house.</p>
				<p>Investigate what Yoox, <a href="http://www.yoox.com" target="_blank" title="www.yoox.com">www.yoox.com</a> has on offer. You may be tempted!</p>
