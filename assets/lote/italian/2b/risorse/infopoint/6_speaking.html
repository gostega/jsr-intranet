<h3>Speaking strategies</h3>

<strong>Tips for speaking</strong>
<p>If you don't know how to say a word, try and explain it in another way using other words. For example:
<blockquote>una cosa per … <br />un tipo di …</blockquote> There are many ways of expressing the same idea.</p>
<p>You cannot express what you want to say in Italian using the same structures you use in English! Try and keep your structures in Italian clear and simple.</p>
<p>Revise regularly and try to incorporate some of the words, phrases and idiomatic expressions into your responses.</p>
<p>Prepare well for a specific speaking task. Prepare answers to questions that are likely to be asked.  However, you need to be flexible. The questions asked may be different to what you anticipated and you need to adapt the information.</p>
<p>If you have access to other students of Italian, Italian exchange students and/or people in the local Italian community take every opportunity to speak Italian as much as possible.</p>

<strong>The interview</strong>
<p>Listen for <strong>question words</strong> as they tell you something about the response.</p>
<p>Ensure your responses are appropriate to the questions asked.</p>
<p>If you do not understand ask for clarification in Italian. For example:
<blockquote>Prego? Non ho capito.</blockquote></p>
<p>Where possible, extend and give detail in your answers.</p>	
<p>Don't worry if you make mistakes. If you do realise you can correct yourself.</p>
<p>Use the appropriate form of address for the situation:
<blockquote><em>Lei</em> &ndash; formal situation<br /><em>Tu</em> &ndash; informal situation</blockquote></p>
