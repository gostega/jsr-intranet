<h3>Online translators</h3>
<p>Online translators are a great innovation; however, skill is required when it comes to making sure that the translation you get is accurate and makes sense.</p>
<p>Most free translator sites use machine rather than human translation and, as a result, have limitations. They are generally only truly accurate on single word or simple phrase translations.</p>
<p>You need to be aware that longer translations will often not be grammatically and syntactically accurate but they can give you an idea of the intended translation at least and point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Some of the most commonly used translation sites are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Babelfish &ndash; an Altavista helpmate which will translate text into a number of different languages <a href="http://altavista.com/" target="_blank">http://altavista.com/</a></li>  
	<li>Free Translator &ndash; translates to and from English with a range of languages <a href="http://www.freetranslation.com/" target="_blank">http://www.freetranslation.com/</a> </li>
	<li>Language Translation &ndash; <a href="http://www.translation.langenberg.com/">http://www.translation.langenberg.com/</a></li>
</ul>
