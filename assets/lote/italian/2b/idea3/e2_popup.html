	<p><strong>Italian trains</strong></p>
	<p>The railway system is serviced by several types of trains. From the <em>locale</em>, which is found in more remote areas and which stops at every station, to the <em>EuroStar</em>, a fast train that travels between different capital cities in Europe.</p>
	<p>When looking at an Italian train timetable, you will notice the following abbreviations:</p>
	<p>ES – EuroStar: a fast comfortable service that travels between European countries.</p>
	<p>EC – Eurocity: an international express train with very few stops.</p>
	<p>IC – Intercity: an express train that stops only at major stations (stops at main stations: supplement).</p>
	<p>R – Rapido: long-distance express that stops in most major cities; high-speed intercity (reservations compulsory).</p>
	<p>EXP – Espresso: a long-distance train that stops at the main stations.</p>
	<p>D – Diretto: a much slower train that stops at many local stations.</p>
	<p>L – Locale: a slow train which stops at every station on the itinerary.</p>
	<p>Some fast trains require a <em><strong>supplemento</strong></em> (extra fare on top of the normal cost because it is a faster train) to be paid.</p>
	<p>Some trains only run on working days (<em><strong>feriale</strong></em>); holidays/Sundays (<em><strong>festivo</strong></em>) or Saturdays; and the eve of a holiday (<em><strong>pre-festivo</strong></em>).</p>
	<p><em>È importante essere in regola con il biglietto</em>. You must <acronym title="validate your ticket">convalidare il biglietto</acronym> at the <acronym title="machines">macchinette obliteratrici</acronym> before you get on board. Depending on the size of the station, these are situated in various locations – within the stazione itself, in the underpass and on <acronym title="platforms">i binari</acronym>.</p>
	<p>The penalty for failing to validate your ticket is a <acronym title="fine">multa</acronym> if you get caught.</p>
	<p>If you have failed to validate your ticket (for whatever reason), you should report this to the <acronym title="inspector">Capotreno</acronym> once you board the train. You will be required to pay a small difference; however, you will avoid a <em>multa</em> of around  &euro; 20,45.</p>
