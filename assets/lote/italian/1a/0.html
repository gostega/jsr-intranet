<p>Unit A Italian gives you the opportunity to learn essential language skills that will help you to 
  communicate <em>in italiano</em>. You&rsquo;ll also discover some fascinating features of Italian culture and tradition along the way.</p>

<p>When you first start learning a language, you usually want to be able to tell people about yourself and find out about other people. What do they like doing? What&rsquo;s their country like? How do I tell them about myself?</p>

<p>When you’ve completed this unit, you’ll be able to communicate in Italian.</p>

<p>There are two parts for you to work through. They are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><acronym title="Desire for friendship">Voglia d’amicizia</acronym></strong> and <strong><acronym title="My world, your world">Il mio mondo il tuo mondo</acronym></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Voglia d’amicizia</em></strong> is all about new friendships. You&rsquo;ll learn how to introduce yourself, ask questions and have a conversation in Italian. You&rsquo;ll have the chance to meet new friends online, communicate with Italian teenagers, find out about the loves and hates of teenagers and what is important to them. You will also have the opportunity to explore some aspects of Italian culture!</p>

<p><strong><em>Il mio mondo il tuo mondo </em></strong>focuses on the personal world of the home and where you live. You will engage in activities associated with these aspects of your world. You will also explore the world of your Italian teenage counterparts. It will help broaden your understanding of what housing and living are like in Italy and provide you with the opportunity to explore the similarities and differences of these two worlds.</p>
