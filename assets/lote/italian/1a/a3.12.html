            You do not expect to be spoken to in Italian on a beach in Australia! What is more amazing is that after a very short time learning Italian, you can actually understand something!<br />

          <p> Hopefully this activity has inspired you and made you feel confident about learning italiano. It is wonderful that you have managed to have a conversation in Italian.
			<br />
			 You need to find opportunities to practise the language as much as possible.
			<br />Why not find out about the possibility of being involved in an exchange program?
			<br />The following are two well-established groups in Western Australia that have exchange programs with Italy. They are: 
			<ul>
				<li>WAATI (WA Association of Teachers of Italian) Intercultural Exchange Program &ndash; ask your teacher for contact details</li>
				<li>Nacel Australia at <a href="http://www.nacel.com.au" target="_blank">www.nacel.com.au</a>.</li>
