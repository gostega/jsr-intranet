<h3>Listening strategies</h3>

<p>It takes a while to get used to someone's voice &ndash; accent, mannerisms, style and pace of delivery &ndash; especially when they are speaking in a foreign language. If you are listening to a recording (eg recorded message, song), don't stress! Give yourself time to adjust to the speaker.</p>
<p>To understand a text it's not important to understand every word. Focus on:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>understanding the context</li>
 <li>understanding as much information as possible by the tone</li>
 <li>key words</li>
 <li>specific information (eg look at the questions that you are expected to answer &ndash; look at the information that you are expected to provide).</li>
</ul>
<p>When listening to an audio file, make notes in Italian to help you recall and make sense of information. It is easier for your brain to process one language at a time when working with audio or audiovisual texts. If you try to listen, interpret into English, then make notes while listening, you will probably find that the process is slower and you will find you get left behind.</p>
<p>Try the following strategy to see if it works for you.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Listen to the text and make notes in Italian.</li>
	<li>Go back over your notes, and make sense of what you have written down. Jot down key points in English.</li>
	<li>When using audio or visual materials, replay a section if you are having difficulties understanding.</li>
	<li>Take every opportunity available to listen to Italian in a variety of contexts.</li>
</ul>
