<h3><acronym title="Bilingual dictionary">Il dizionario</acronym></h3>
<strong>Why use a bilingual dictionary?</strong>

<p>You can use a bilingual dictionary to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>look up an Italian word you have heard/read whose meaning you don’t know</li>
    <li>look up an Italian word for your own use in speaking/writing</li>
    <li>check the gender of an Italian word</li>
    <li>check the spelling of known Italian words</li>
    <li>check the verb tables to help you in your writing.</li>
</ul>

<strong>What will a bilingual dictionary not give you?</strong>
<p>A bilingual dictionary will not give you:</p>

<ul>
    <li>all the parts of a verb – only the infinitive</li>
    <li>all the tenses of a verb – usually only selected forms of irregular verbs are given</li>
    <li>plural and feminine forms of regular adjectives (ones that follow normal rules)</li>
    <li>the plural form of most nouns</li>
    <li>lots of different meanings (particularly small dictionaries).</li>
</ul>

	<ul>
	    <li>When reading or listening to a text, do not look up every word that you don’t know. Guess the meaning from the context (the sentence or paragraph in which the word appears).</li>
	    <li>Read through all the dictionary entries to have the best possible chance of getting the correct meaning for that context in English.</li>
	    <li>After looking up the meaning of an Italian word, ensure that you have expressed your answer in good English. A string of words found in a dictionary does not constitute a correct answer.</li>

	    <li>Read through all the entries to give yourself the best possible chance of choosing the correct expression for your purpose.</li>
	    <li>Take note of the part of speech so that you can make sure that you have chosen the correct word. Many words can have different roles in a sentence and can therefore be different parts of speech, for example a word can be a noun and a verb, depending on the context.</li>
	    <li>Take note of familiar words and vulgar words and use them only when appropriate.</li>

<p>Strategies for learning new vocabulary</p>
<p>Decide if a new word is one that you will probably use again. If it is, record the word somewhere.
<p>Organise new words on cards, in a notebook or on your computer either:</p>
	<li>by theme, or</li>
	<li>alphabetically.  </li>
<p>Remember that the gender is part of a word. Use either:</p>
	<li>the definite/indefinite article, or</li>
	<li>(m)/(f) after the word.</li>
<p>Write new words in a phrase or sentence either:</p>
	<li>from the context in which you came across it, or</li>
	<li>write your own context.</li>
<p>Review your vocabulary frequently, not just before tests or exams. </p>
<p>Get someone to test you, or set yourself a test, for example remembering 10 expressions related to a theme that you have studied. </p>
