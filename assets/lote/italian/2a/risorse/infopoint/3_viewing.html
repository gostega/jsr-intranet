<h3>Viewing strategies</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Relax! Don't stress. Being relaxed and positive helps you to be more receptive.</li>
 <li>Look for contextual clues that help you guess the meaning of what is going on.</li>
 <li>Focus on the questions or the response that you are expected to provide.</li>
 <li>Look at body language &ndash; this may also help you make meaning of the content.</li>
 <li>Watch the video several times to familiarise yourself with the voices and the content.</li>
 <li>Make notes of words/phrases that you are able to understand.</li>
 <li>Replay films/recordings &ndash; look and listen for different things each time.</li> 
 <li>Enjoy the viewing!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't understand everything or not very much <em>non ti preoccupare!</em> You are not expected to. </p>
<p>Remember that you are listening to native speakers so the speed may be fast. The reality is that it is normal speed for a native speaker! It is probably the same speed that you use speaking in English. </p>
