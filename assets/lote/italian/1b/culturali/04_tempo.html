<h3>Tempo libero in Italia!</h3><img src="images/AW24.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Rome city centre where all teenagers hang out." align="right"/>
<p><strong><em>Andare in centro</em></strong> signifies many things <em>per i giovani italiani</em>. It is the place to meet up with <em>gli amici in piazza</em>, to go and eat a <em>pizza al taglio, prendere un gelato, guardare le vetrine e così via</em> and so on. Very often the main purpose is purely to socialise!! <em><strong>Andare in discoteca</strong></em> is another important aspect of teenage social life.</p>
<p><strong><em>La febbre di sabato sera!</em></strong> is an Italian teenage phenomenon.</p>
<p>Discos in Italia usually open after 11pm. Unlike in Australia, you don’t have to be 18 to go to a disco.</p>
<p>In Italy there is a difference between night clubs and discos. To get into a night club, there is an age restriction – you have to be 18, the same as in Australia.</p>
<p>Teenagers usually meet before in a <em>pizzeria</em> or the local <em>piazza</em> before going to the disco to socialise and chat with friends.</p>
<p>Being such a late start it is common for teenagers to <em><acronym title="have a very late night!">fare le ore piccole!</acronym></em></p>
<p>There are also under age teenage discos where teenagers as young as 13 can go – these usually start in the late afternoon.</p>
