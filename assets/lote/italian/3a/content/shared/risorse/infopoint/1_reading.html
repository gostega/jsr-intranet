<h3>Reading strategies</h3>

<p>When trying to understand and make meaning of written texts in another language look at:</p>
<ul>
 <li>title and graphics and get an idea of what type of text it is. Photos, pictures and titles will give you information before even reading the text</li>
 <li>clue words you know or recognise</li>
 <li>words with links to English</li>
 <li>familiar words within larger words</li>
 <li>context of the passage</li>
 <li>punctuation, for example, a question mark indicates a question and words that begin with a capital are usually proper nouns (names). </li>
</ul>
<p>You can often guess the meaning… around them. By using the techniques described above, you should only need to look up words that seem crucial and whose  meaning you can’t guess.</p>
