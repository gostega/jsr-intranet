			<p><strong>GIA mission statement</strong></p>
			<p><em>Giovani Italiani Australia</em> was founded by Italian&ndash;Australian youth in order to give voice to Italo&ndash;Australian youth both in Australia and in Italy. It aims to be a national, apolitical, unaffiliated, non-exclusive, and broadly represented youth association that recognises and supports the needs, experiences and skills of youth of Italian background across Australia between the ages of 18 and 35.</p>
			<p><em>Giovani Italiani Australia</em> was founded as a national body with state representatives in order to foster links and collaboration with all other existing Italian&ndash;Australian youth associations and individuals, and to actively participate in the Italian&ndash;Australian community and its institutions, helping to bridge the gap between generations and provide support and representation for Italian&ndash;Australian youth.</p>
			<p><em>Giovani Italiani Australia</em> considers it a responsibility of the association and its members to actively work with Italian Australian institutions such as the Italian Consulates and the Com.It.Es, and with Italian institutions abroad such as the CGIE, in order to ensure that youth needs are met and youth initiatives and concerns are expressed. In order to fully and fairly represent Italian Australian youth in this way, <em>Giovani Italiani Australia</em> also considers it a responsibility to provide a common website available to all youth who wish to join and participate as an active centre for dialogue and exchange, and to actively organise a National Conference for Italian&ndash;Australian youth on a yearly or biennial basis as a forum where youth can meet, voice their needs and concerns, exchange ideas and support each other's initiatives, confident that the outcomes will then be placed before the above-mentioned institutions for discussion and active follow-up.</p>
