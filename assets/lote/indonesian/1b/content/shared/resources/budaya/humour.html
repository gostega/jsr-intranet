<p>Insults are very much part of the Australian culture and Australian humour. People from other cultures are often confused when they hear Australians insulting each other jokingly. It is important to understand that humour differs between different cultures. Indonesians will joke around with mild insults, but calling someone an animal is usually a serious insult, because animals are considered lower than humans. </p>

<p>While calling anyone an animal name is very rude, the use of the terms 'pig' and 'dog' are considered especially rude, partly because both of these animals are considered unclean in Islam. While some Muslims are more casual and have pet dogs, others will not touch them at all, and pigs are definitely off limits. One friend tells a story of a pig-farmer in a village who could only sell his car to a non-Muslim, as none of the Muslim villagers would buy it. The film Babe was not released in Indonesia as most people would have found it disgusting rather than cute or funny. Therefore using the term 'pig' or 'dog' to refer to someone is very offensive. You may hear them used in situations where people are extremely angry; for example, a driver suffering from road rage may mutter <em>'anjing'</em> about another driver. However, just as one Australian may think something is okay to say, another might find it very offensive and rude. In Indonesia, just as in Australia, some people are ultra-polite and would never trade insults, and others are far more casual about it. </p>



<p>It is important to be aware that animal insults are treading a fine line between humour and offence and can only be used in a very close relationship. For example, a friend called his slightly overweight (a good rather than a bad thing in Indonesia) sister <em><acronym title="hippopotamus">kuda nil</acronym></em>, but it would be inadvisable to try out animal insults on anyone.</p>
<p>There are some much gentler insults that are used jokingly between close friends. For example, dodol is a type of sweet fudge made out of coconut milk, but is also used to insult a friend who has said something silly. <em><acronym title="You coconut fudge brain">Kamu dodol!</acronym></em></p>

<p>An old favourite (when you know people well, for example housemates) is used when opening a conversation by asking someone if they have <em><acronym title="already had a bath">'sudah mandi?'</acronym></em> If the person says <em><acronym title="not yet had a bath">'belum mandi'</acronym></em>, if the relationship is close, they are likely to be teased and told: <em><acronym title="you smell">'lu bau'</acronym></em>.</p>

<p>You have to be very sure that you are on good enough terms with someone to try out humour in another culture. It's best to be on the receiving end first before trying a joke, and to have a very good understanding of what sort of humour works and what doesn't.</p>


<h3>Sarcasm </h3>
<p>Sarcasm is one part of humour that just does not translate to many other cultures, including Indonesian. The following exchange between Jess (who is now an Indonesian teacher) and Mohammad (a very common Muslim name, and the name of the founder and chief prophet of Islam) at a party in Java, did not go very well.</p>
<p>Jess: Kenalkan, nama saya Jess.</p>
<p>Mohammad: Kenalkan, nama saya Mohammad.</p>
<p>Jess: Wah, Mohammad. Anda pasti beragama Hindu.</p>
<p>Mohammad: (looking very confused) Bukan. Saya beragama Islam. Saya dinamakan dari Nabi Mohammad.</p>
<p>Jess's Australian friend runs away stuffing her hands in her mouth to keep from bursting out laughing, while Jess stands there and listens to a lecture on the history of Islam. Jess never used sarcasm in Indonesia again.</p>
