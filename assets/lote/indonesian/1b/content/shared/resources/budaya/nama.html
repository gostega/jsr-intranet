<h2>Nama orang</h2>

<p>There are many naming conventions in Indonesia, often following naming conventions of the ethnic group. These are often very complex, and do not follow the pattern of personal name, family name. Many people only have one name, which may or may not be similar to their parents'. This can be confusing when it comes to filling in English language forms, which generally have at least two spaces for surname, given names and other names. One Indonesian lecturer who migrated to Australia filled in his official forms by putting 'Nil' under 'given names'. For years after that, he received mail addressed to Mr Nil Soebardi!</p>

<h3>Male or female?</h3>
<p>In Java, it is quite common for male names to end in 'o' (such as Soeharto, Soekarno, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, three of the male presidents of Indonesia), and for female names to end in 'i' (Megawati Soekarnoputri, Indonesia's fifth president).</p>

<p>If you are writing a letter to someone whose gender is not obvious and you are unsure if they are male or female, you can guess that:</p>
<ul>
<li>names ending with an 'o' are male and the person should be addressed as <em>Bapak</em> </li>
<li>names ending with 'i' are female and should be addressed as <em>Ibu</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are exceptions (such as Nuri and Budi, which are used for males) so, if you are unsure, you can simply address the person as <em>Anda</em>.</p>

<p>There are also names that are used for both males and females, such as Wahyu in Java, or Wayan in Bali. The Balinese naming system is unique, and something Balinese will generally explain to you as soon as you arrive in Bali. Find out more about the Balinese naming system by asking someone who has been to Bali or looking on the internet. What would your Balinese name be?</p>

<h4>Patronymic names</h4>
<p>Megawati Sukarnoputri, Indonesia's fifth president and daughter of Indonesia's first president, is an example of a <strong>patronymic naming convention</strong>. This means that the name is composed of the father's name (Soekarno) with <acronym title="daughter">-putri</acronym> added for a female, or <acronym title="son">-putra</acronym> for a male.</p>
<p>Search 'Indonesian names' on the internet for more information.</p>
<h4>A note on spelling</h4>
<p>In 1972, then president Soeharto implemented a set of changes to the spelling system to make it more <acronym title="spelled as it sounds">phonetic</acronym>. (This also made the spelling more unique and distanced it from its Dutch-influenced origins.) Words (including names) that were formerly spelled with an 'oe' had their spelling changed to 'u', so Soeharto became Suharto. People born before this time generally kept the same spelling, but you will still see variations of spelling, especially place names and personal names. Other spelling changes included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dj &rarr; J (as in Djakarta/Jakarta)</li>
<li>J &rarr; Y (as in Surabaja/Surabaya)</li>
<li>Tj &rarr; C (pronounced 'ch')</li>
</ul>
