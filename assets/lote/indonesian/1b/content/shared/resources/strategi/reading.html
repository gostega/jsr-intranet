<h2>Strategi membaca <em>(Reading strategies)</em></h2>
<p>Reading can be daunting when there are unfamiliar words &ndash; whether they are in English or in a foreign language. When you are reading something in your first language that has a word you don't know (say a scientific text), you probably don't freak out, start crying and stop reading! Usually, you would just:</p>
<ul>
<li>read past the word and try to guess its meaning; then</li>
<li>check the dictionary to see if you are right.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also a good strategy to use in Indonesian, even though there may be more words you don't know. </p>
<p>Other things you can do include the following.</p>
<h3>Before you read</h3>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I know about the text before I start reading?</li>
<li>What do I know about the text type, pictures, and surrounding information?</li>
<li>What is the text-type?</li>
<li>Who is the text aimed at?</li>
<li>What is the purpose of the text?</li>
<li>What have I been told about the text?</li>
<li>What does the task say? What do I need to do or find out?</li>
</ul>
<h3>While you read</h3>
<p>You should:</p>
<ul>
<li>skim-read to get a general impression of themes, purpose and main topic, ignoring words you don't know</li>
<li>scan for key information such as the title, headings and subheadings and work out what they mean</li>
<li>use key words, cognates (words that are adapted from English) and the words before and after a word or phrase you don't know to deduce meaning</li>
<li>read a whole sentence, skipping over words you don't know and seeing if you can guess the meaning from the bits you do understand (this is called reading for gist)</li>
<li>highlight repeated words that you don't recognise and can't guess the meaning of</li>
<li>use your dictionary to look up key words. Check out the <a href="dictionary.html" target="_blank" title="dictionary skills">dictionary skills</a> for tips on how to do this.</li>
</ul>

<div class="info warning">
<p>Be very careful not to overuse your dictionary. You should:</p>
<ul>
<li>trust yourself â€“ often your first instinct as to what the word means is right</li>
<li>be sure the word is not a cognate</li>
<li>limit the words you look up to only key words that significantly alter the meaning of a sentence that you cannot guess.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Also, in Indonesian, remembering certain grammar points can help you. For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>looking at the base-word is important so you can guess the meaning or find the word</li>
<li>you can often work out whether the word is a verb or a noun by looking at the  <a href="dictionary.html" target="_blank" title="dictionary skills">affixes</a> (for example, it starts with a <em>me-</em>, therefore it's a verb or doing word)</li>
<li>a word following a noun may be an adjective.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Remember:</h4>
<ul>
<li>you don't have to understand every word </li>
<li>don't worry, you can do it! </li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading strategy practice</h3>
<ol>
<li>Choose a passage to read without referring to your dictionary. </li>
<li>Take a minute to write down what you think the passage is about. </li>
<li>Underline or highlight words you don't know and think are significant.</li> 
<li>Pick five of these words which you think are most important to understand more of the passage and underline them. Look them up now. </li>
<li>Read the passage again. Were the five words useful in working out more of the meaning? </li>
<li>Look up some other words. Were any of them more important?</li>
</ol>
