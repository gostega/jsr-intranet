    <h3>Memorising strategies</h3>
<strong>Look say write cover repeat</strong>
<p>Fold a sheet of lined paper into four columns. Write a list of words (5 words is enough) in the first column. Write the English in the second column, then turn the first column over so you can&rsquo;t see it and write the Indonesian words again in column 3. Hide column 2 and write the English list again in column 4. Each time you write a word, whether Indonesian or English, say the Indonesian.</p>
<strong>Flashcards</strong>
<p>Make sets of flashcards from paper or card. Write an Indonesian word or phrase that you want to learn on one side and the English on the other. For any group of 5 cards you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the Indonesian out loud to practice your pronunciation. </li>
<li>Read the Indonesian word out loud, say the English without looking then turn the card over to check. </li>
<li>Read the English (No need to say it aloud). Say the Indonesian without looking then turn the card over to check. </li>
<li>Sort cards into those you are confident you have memorised and those that you need to practise more. </li>
<li>Pick a card - any card &ndash; and challenge yourself (or a partner) to use it in a sentence. </li>
<li>Make double sets of cards and race to match the Indonesian of one set with the English of another. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>List it. </strong> Keep a vocabulary log (vlog?) (in an exercise book, a spreadsheet, list on the toilet wall) of useful Indonesian words. Show their meanings as English words, as diagrams or in a mind map but always in pencil. Periodically go back over the log and erase the pencil notations of words that you have memorised. This is a great way of proving to yourself how much you have learned. </p>
<p><strong>Learn words in context.</strong> Collect useful expressions and phrases, even sentences. Don&rsquo;t restrict yourself to memorising single words. Idiomatic expressions and proverbs will enliven your spoken and written Indonesian. </p>
<p><strong>Families of words. </strong> As you learn more about the affix system, make small posters of word families, for example the <em>lihat</em> family. Use only Indonesian and sketches on the poster. Reviewing these posters will help reinforce the base word and affix system. </p>
<p><strong>Cognates. </strong> Indonesian has &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo; or &lsquo;adopted&rsquo; many words from other languages, including English. Often they are easily recognised, for example komputer, but it&rsquo;s not always so easy. If you come across an unfamiliar word, saying it aloud may reveal it as an adopted word or cognate. Examples include <em>rileks</em> (relax), <em>elpiji</em> (LPG). </p>
<p><strong>Create puzzles</strong>, wordsleuths, crosswords etc and share them with a learning partner. </p>
<p><strong>Act out</strong> &ndash; perform an action while saying it. </p>
<p><strong>Get a better &lsquo;feel&rsquo;</strong> for a word and its spelling by writing it with your finger in the air, on your desk or in the sand. Make the movements of your hand and arm quite large. </p>
