    <h3><acronym title="Prefixes and suffixes">Awalan dan akhiran</acronym> (Prefixes and suffixes)</h3>
    <p><em>Awal</em> = beginning/early <br />
        <em>Awalan</em> = thing that comes first = a prefix (something  that goes on the start of a word)<br />
        <em>Akhir</em> = end<br />
        <em>Akhiran</em> = thing  that comes last = a suffix (something that goes on the end of a word)<br />
      Affixes (prefixes and suffixes) are very important in  Indonesian, as they can help you figure out where to find a word in the  dictionary, and its meaning.</p>
    <p> Most importantly, they can help you know whether a word is a <strong>noun</strong> (a thing or object) or a <strong>verb</strong>. In English, you can tell if a  word is a <strong>noun</strong> if you can put &lsquo;the&rsquo;, &lsquo;a&rsquo; or &lsquo;an&rsquo; in front of it. For example, &lsquo;experience&rsquo;. You can say &lsquo;an experience&rsquo;, therefore you know that the word is a noun.</p>
    <p>      <strong>Verbs</strong> can have  the word &lsquo;to&rsquo; put in front of their base-word. For example, throwing &ndash; base-word  is throw. You can say &lsquo;to throw&rsquo;, therefore throw is a verb.<br />
      In Indonesian, nouns and verbs often have different affixes.</p>

    <h4>Words  that could be nouns or verbs </h4>
    <p>When you are  looking up an English word to find the Indonesian, there are often a lot of  choices. One thing you need to ask yourself is what sort of word you are  looking for; For example, is it a noun or a verb? Some words in English can be  either. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Experience,  as in &lsquo;you will experience problems this week&rsquo;, is a verb.</li>
      <li>Experience,  as in &lsquo;the experience will strengthen you&rsquo;, is a noun.</li>
      <li>&lsquo;Show&rsquo;  can also be a noun or a verb (watching a <strong>show</strong>,  or to <strong>show</strong> something). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In Indonesian,  affixes can indicate whether the word is a noun or a verb. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Words with &lsquo;me-&rsquo;, and &lsquo;ber-&rsquo; prefixes are verbs. </li>
      <li>Words with &lsquo;-an&rsquo; suffixes are nouns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So if you wanted  to say &lsquo;I want to <strong>visit</strong> my friend&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll be looking for a word beginning with &lsquo;me-&rsquo; or &lsquo;ber-&rsquo;. If you want to say &lsquo;It was a nice <strong>visit&rsquo;</strong>, you&rsquo;ll be looking for a &lsquo;-an&rsquo; suffix.<br />
      Try translating  the following sentences.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I went  to visit my cousins in New Zealand. It was a nice visit.</li>
      <li>She  hit the ball. It was a hard hit!</li>
    </ul>

        <td><img src="../images/icon_takecare96.jpg" alt="Take care icon" width="96" height="96" border="0" /></td>
        <td class="blueBox"><em>Hati-hati!</em> There are exceptions &ndash;  the word you are looking for may just be a base-word. The best way to find out  is to find the example sentence closest to yours in the dictionary.</td>
