    <h3>Viewing strategies</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Relax and recognise that you are going to need to view the text a few times to make sense of it.  A relaxed, positive mind is more receptive than a stressed-out, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do this&rsquo; mind!</li>
<li>View a text the first time for visual and contextual clues that help you guess the meaning of what is going on.</li>
<li>View the text a second time, listening carefully for aural clues. Jot down key words and phrases.</li>
<li>When you make notes, listen for key words and write them down in Indonesian. Don&rsquo;t try to translate them immediately &ndash; it will take too long and you will miss the next few key words or clues. Go over them after you have finished viewing to make sense of them.</li>
<li>Replay, looking and listening for more information.</li>
<li>Enjoy watching!</li></ul>
