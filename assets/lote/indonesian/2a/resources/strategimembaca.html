     <h3><acronym title="Reading strategies">Strategi membaca</acronym></h3>
   <h4><acronym title="Looking for understanding!">Cari pengertian!</acronym></h4>
     <p> The most important things to remember when dealing with an unfamiliar reading text are:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>you don&rsquo;t have to understand every word</li>
      <li>don&rsquo;t worry, you can do it!</li></ul> 
	  
    <h4> Pre-reading</h4>
    <p> Before you get seriously into reading a text, you should use some simple strategies to gain clues as to what the text is about. For example:</p>
<ul>      
<li>Recognise clues that tell you what kind of text it is (eg magazine, newspaper article, email).</li>
<li>Use all the visual and contextual clues you can (pictures, layout, headings) to get a general idea of themes, purpose and main topic of the text.</li>
<li>Look at titles and subtitles for information.</li>
</ul>
      <p>This <a href="docs/reading_fw.doc" target="_blank">text-reading framework</a> will help guide your reading. <br />
      There is also an <a href="docs/reading_fw_eg.doc" target="_blank">example</a> to accompany it.  </p>
    <h4> Reading</h4>
    <p> When reading you can use a range of strategies, including the following. </p>
<ul>     
<li>Read the headings and topic sentences (first sentence) of each paragraph.</li>
<li>Use highlighting to either identify words you do know, or words you don&rsquo;t know but think are important to deciphering the meaning. </li>
<li>Skim-read to get a general impression of the text, ignoring words you don&rsquo;t know.</li>
<li>Use key words and cognates (words that are adapted from English) to deduce meaning. Guess the meaning of words from the words around them.</li>
<li>Look at base-words to guess the meaning of the word, and use your knowledge of affixes (for example, it starts with a me-, therefore it&rsquo;s a verb or doing word) to make meaning.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t overuse your dictionary! Only look up words that seem crucial and whose meaning you can&rsquo;t guess.</li>
</ul>
    <h4> Reading strategy practice</h4>
    <ol><li>Choose a passage to read without referring to your dictionary. </li>
      <li>Take a minute to write down what you think the passage is about. </li>
      <li>Now underline or highlight words you don&rsquo;t know and think are significant.</li>
      <li>Pick five of these words which you think are most important to understand more of the passage and underline them. Look them up now.</li>
      <li>Read the passage again. Were the five words useful in working out more of the meaning?</li>
      <li>Look up some other words. Were any of them more important?</li>
	</ol>
    <div class="yellowBox">You do not need to know every word to get the gist of a passage. <br />
    Sometimes you can work out answers to questions without looking up any words. You can do this by scanning the text for specific information you need to complete the task.
