    <h3>Writing strategies</h3>
    <p>There are a lot of strategies you can employ when writing!<br />
        <strong>Plan</strong> &ndash; plan your overall  ideas, themes, content, paragraphs, development of ideas.<br />
        <strong>Consider</strong> the <strong>conventions </strong>or<strong> features </strong>of the text (eg the  layout of a brochure, the sort of language used in an advertisement), the  purpose of the text (informational/educational/persuasive) and the audience  (who it is aimed at). These three are interrelated and will affect the language  you use. <br />
        <br />

    <p>  For example, the language and  conventions you use in an advertisement (text-type) aimed at getting teenagers  (audience) to buy a new mobile phone (purpose) will be different to the  language and conventions you would employ in writing a job application.</p>
    <h4>Paragraphing conventions</h4>
    <p>If you are writing  an essay or a story, or even a brochure, you should use paragraphing  conventions. The <strong>topic sentence</strong> (first sentence) should introduce  the main point of a paragraph. This should be followed by the <strong>body</strong> of the paragraph, including  supporting evidence or information, and concluded with a <strong>closing sentence</strong> which restates the main point or argument.</p>
    <p>        <strong>Link paragraphs</strong> so the  text flows and develops. If the first sentence in one paragraph is somehow  linked to the last sentence in the last paragraph, then your writing flows  nicely. It may be linked by theme (for example chillies), by an indicator of  time passing (&lsquo;not long after the chilli has been eaten &hellip;&rsquo;), or by a deliberate  link phrase (&lsquo;Another type of chilli &hellip;&rsquo;, &lsquo;Although chillies are popular in Indonesia  &hellip;&rsquo;, &lsquo;It has been suggested that chillies &hellip;&rsquo;).</p>
    <h4>Add interest by using description</h4>
    <p>Of the following three opening lines to a story, which is  the more gripping sentence?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tono was a boy.</li>
      <li>Tono was a naughty 12-year-old boy.</li>
      <li>Tono was a naughty 12-year-old boy who was  extremely fond of chillies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Did you choose the last one? Why? Description is used, as  well as a link word (&lsquo;who&rsquo;) to extend the sentence.</p>
    <h4>Adding interest by using variety</h4>
    <p>One way of varying your writing is to not use the same  adjective all the time. Let&rsquo;s face it, <em>bagus </em>is a great word (<em>mohon  maaf atas leluconnya </em>&hellip;). But if you use <em>bagus</em> 27 times in a page of  writing, it gets repetitive and looks as though you don&rsquo;t know many other  words. It is far better to show off your skill in a language than bore your  audience. &nbsp;So, if you find yourself using  a word over and over, try to vary it. For example, instead of <em>bagus</em>, use <em>menarik, menyenangkan, cantik, luar biasa &hellip; </em></p>
    <p>      You can also <strong>modify </strong>adjectives  by using words like &lsquo;very&rsquo;, &lsquo;extremely&rsquo;, &lsquo;not so&rsquo;. <em>Sekali</em> is another word that can be over-used, as there are options  like <em>sangat, amat, </em>and even the slang  form <em>banget</em> to make things a little  more interesting.</p>
    <p>      <strong>Don&rsquo;t be scared of experimenting! </strong>
