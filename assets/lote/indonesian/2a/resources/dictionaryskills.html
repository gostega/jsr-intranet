    <h3>Dictionary skills</h3>
    <p> <strong>Use the right dictionary!</strong> Even the most experienced of us know the feeling &lsquo;Hey! That word&rsquo;s not in the diction&ndash;&hellip; oh! I&rsquo;m in the wrong dictionary &hellip;&rsquo;. <em>Malu pasti</em>, but it does happen.</p>
    <h4> Be aware of the conventions of your dictionary </h4>
    <p>Different dictionaries will have different explanations. Some examples include the following.</p>
	<ul>
<li>Often the noun form is the first word listed (eg bat &ndash; &lsquo;a bat&rsquo; comes before &lsquo;to bat&rsquo;).</li>
<li>Abbreviations are often used (eg kb. means kata benda or noun. It is not the translation of the word you are looking for!).</li>
<li>Slashes are used to show you how to pronounce the word. They are not the translation! eg &lsquo;Think/thingk/: pikiran&rsquo;. The word for &lsquo;think&rsquo; is pikiran; &lsquo;thingk&rsquo; describes how to say the word &lsquo;think&rsquo;.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Lih.&rsquo; is short for lihat which means &lsquo;see&rsquo;. So if you look up &lsquo;threw&rsquo;, it would say &lsquo;lih. throw&rsquo; (see throw).</li>
</ul>
    <h4>Finding the meaning of Indonesian words</h4>
    <p>Affixes are extremely important. By now, you should know not to look up a ber- word under &lsquo;b&rsquo; (or a &lsquo;me-&lsquo; verb under &lsquo;m&rsquo;) but under the first letter of the base-word. Other prefixes include:</p>
	<ul>
<li><em>di- </em></li>
<li><em>pe-</em> 	(plus peng, pem, peny, pen &ndash; added the same way as me- affixes)</li>
<li><em>ke- </em>(usually there&rsquo;s an -an at the end too)</li>
<li><em>ter-</em>.</li> 
</ul>
    <h4>Finding the meaning of English words</h4>
    <p>Look up the base-word in English (for example, throwing/threw look up &lsquo;throw&rsquo;)</p>
    <h4>Choosing the correct word</h4>
    <p>You want to find out the Indonesian for the word &lsquo;bat&rsquo;. First, work out exactly the context you want to use the word in. Do you mean:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>an implement used in cricket?</li>
  <li>a small nocturnal flying mammal?</li>
  <li>an action of hitting something (&lsquo;whose turn to bat?&rsquo;)</li>
  </ul> 
   <p> <strong>What sort of word are you looking  for?</strong> &ndash;  are you looking for a noun, a verb, an adjective, something else? It gets  tricky if you are looking for an English word that can be a noun or a verb &ndash; for  example, drink. Are you looking for the action &lsquo;to drink&rsquo;, or the noun &lsquo;a  drink&rsquo;? If you want to say &lsquo;I drink water&rsquo; you need <em>minum. </em>If you want  to say &lsquo;that drink was nice,&rsquo; use<em> minuman. </em> </p>
    <p> If it&rsquo;s a verb, is it passive or active? I threw the ball =  active = me-verb. The ball was thrown by Dave = passive = di-verb.</p>
    <p> If there are multiple words listed in the dictionary (and  there often are) look for the word that in context &ndash; ie in a sentence &ndash; that is  closest to the meaning you want. <br />
      Look through the whole entry. If I want to say &lsquo;she <strong>left</strong> him behind&rsquo;, you will find that  there may be an exact entry in the dictionary for &lsquo;left behind&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want  the word for &lsquo;left-handed&rsquo;, or &lsquo;there were three left&rsquo;, or &lsquo;she left town&rsquo;. The  closest meaning may be something like &lsquo;he left his bike at the gate&rsquo;.</p>
