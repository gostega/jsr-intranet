<p><strong>Cinta:</strong> The main thing is you have to take a stand.<br />
  <br />
    <strong>Alya:</strong> It&rsquo;s up to you if you believe it or not. Dad,  after being like that, is like a person unaware of themselves, don&rsquo;t you know?  After running amok, he&rsquo;ll cry like a little child, be so sorry, kiss Mum, hug  me&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Cinta:</strong> In <strong>any</strong> situation, we are always together!  So if you have a problem, don&rsquo;t keep it to yourself. Share it. You want to  phone me at whatever hour, you can. You want to come at any hour, I&rsquo;ll open the  door.</p>
