<h2>Musik di Indonesia</h2>
<h3><acronym title="What is dangdut?">Apa itu dangdut?</acronym></h3>
<p><em>Dangdut</em> is an Indonesian blend of Indian, Arabic and Western rock. It has been popular in Indonesia since the 1970s, particularly amongst poorer Islamic youth. Different sub-genres of dangdut have emerged, with dangdut nightclubs with DJs mixing the latest local and Western music styles with the traditional dangdut style. Sometimes dangdut has a political message, but quite often it is not far from the typical pop song about love.</p>
<p>Try searching 'dangdut' to see what you can find.</p>

<h3>Musik <em>underground</em></h3>
<p>For a long time, Indonesia had very strict laws against criticising the government in any way. Anyone who spoke out against the government ran the risk of heavy penalties such as imprisonment. The media were very heavily censored, and producers of art works that could be considered critical of the government also faced the threat of reprisal. At one stage in the sixties, foreign music was banned. At another point, all rock concerts were banned. Various artists had their work banned or their tours cancelled, or they could not get their work published through official channels in the first place. This oppression made people even more determined to speak out, and the banning of protest songs made them even more popular. A huge underground music industry evolved, publishing both local music that would not otherwise be produced, and selling pirated copies of music.</p>

<h3>Musik protes</h3>
<p>One artist who gained fame (and infamy) in Indonesia was Iwan Fals. Known as the Bob Dylan of Indonesia, Iwan Fals wrote, recorded and performed protest songs against social inequalities in Indonesia (particularly the plight of poor people), frequently criticising the government. At one stage he was banned from touring in Indonesia. Iwan Fals' folk style and lyrics about the plight of the people struck a chord, particularly with the majority lower class, across Indonesia. Since the release of his first album in 1979 at the age of 18, Iwan Fals remains one of Indonesia's most beloved and most prolific artists.</p>

<h3>Musik punk</h3>

<p>An element of the Indonesian underground music scene to emerge later was the punk scene. In the 1990s, about twenty years after the punk movement began in Britain, many Indonesian youths expressed their discontent with the government and the standard 'establishment' way of doing things by adopting the punk style, complete with mohawks, body piercing and leather. Anti-government ideas, music and fashion all became important parts of the punk identity. Punk is strongly associated with political activism, and also anger and violence, which means that this subculture often gets bad press in mainstream publications, such as newspapers which want to (or have to) stay on the right side of the government.</p>

<p>Search the Internet for a video clip on 'punkasila' to see a political Indonesian punk band in action.</p>
<p>One popular Balinese punk band is Superman is Dead. Check out their website. <a href="http://www.supermanisdead.net" title="Superman is Dead website" target="_blank">www.supermanisdead.net/</a></p>
